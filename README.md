<h1>Learning Assembly Programming Language</h1>
A personal repo documenting my progress of learning Assembly Language Programming. This repo serves as a collection of notes, practice code, and projects that explore low-level programming concepts.

<h2>Repo Structure</h2>
--> notes/
--> examples/
--> exercises/
--> projects/
--> resources/
--> README.md

<h2>Goals</h2>
1. Develope an intuitive understanding of how computers execute instructions
2. Strengthen debugging and low-level programming skills
3. Build a portfolio of assembly related projects and exercises
4. Create a resource that I can reference later, as well as others can reference

<h4>This repo is strictly for my personal learning, but if you find mistakes or want to share helpful resources, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.</h4>
