# learning-assembly
A personal repo documenting my progress of learning Assembly Language Programming. This repo serves as a collection of notes, practice code, and projects that explore low-level programming concepts.

#Repo Structure

#Goals
1. Develope an intuitive understanding of how computers execute instructions
2. Strengthen debugging and low-level programming skills
3. Build a portfolio of assembly related projects and exercises
4. Create a resource that I can reference later, as well as others can reference

This repo is strictly for my personal learning, but if you find mistakes or want to share helpful resources, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
