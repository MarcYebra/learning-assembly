Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM) are the two primary memory types. 

RAM can be changed as the computer operates and its contents delete when the computer turns off, while ROM is permanent.

ROM is for standard data and basic parts of the computer's OS. When the CPU starts up, it always boots with a fixed address in the IP. The start-up location
is an address in the ROM. Programs in the ROM lie between hardware and software and is called Firmware. 

Firmware is a type of software permanently stored in the ROM to provide low-level control for the hardware.
