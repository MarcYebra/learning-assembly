Machine Language refers to the numbers transferred into the computer's memory. 

Assembly Language allows us to use symbolic names for operations and represent actions with names to store in memory locations.

In summary, the Assembly Language simply acts as a symbolic communications style for Machine Language. It would be very time consuming and difficult
for programmers to write entire programs in Machine Langauge. There would be more errors, and would be difficult for other programmers to understand,
therefore, Assembly Language introduces a starting solution. 
To be even more technical, the true machine language is not what we call it (with numbers), the real machine language consists of voltages, currents, etc.

Wether you refer to Machine Language or Assembly Language, all of the calculations performed by these languages are performed in the CPU or the Central Processing Unit. 
The CPU is organized into two parts:
    1. Arithmetic and Logic
    2. Control Unit

The Arithmetic and Logic part performs computations, while the Control Unit fetches info and stores info into the memory unit, and tells the Arithmetic and Logic part and
I/O devices which operations to perform.
