Introduction: How Assembly Language Works

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides a direct way to communicate with a computer’s hardware. Unlike high-level languages such as Python or Java,
assembly language is closely tied to the computer’s architecture and uses symbolic instructions, called mnemonics, to represent the machine code instructions executed by the CPU. 
Each assembly instruction typically corresponds to one machine operation, such as moving data between registers, performing arithmetic, or controlling program flow.

When a programmer writes assembly code, it must be translated into machine code using an assembler, which converts the human-readable mnemonics (like MOV, ADD, or JMP) into binary 
instructions that the CPU can execute. This process gives programmers precise control over how hardware resources—such as memory, registers, and input/output devices—are managed.

Although assembly language is harder to write and read compared to high-level languages, it’s valuable for understanding how computers work internally. It’s often used in embedded 
systems, operating system kernels, and performance-critical applications, where efficiency and direct hardware manipulation are essential.
